// The console's Content-Security-Policy, in one module so it is built once and read everywhere.
//
// Emitting it inline in `next.config.mjs` through the static `headers()` table allows exactly
// one directive: `frame-ancestors`. That is an anti-clickjacking control and
// nothing else. There was no `default-src`, no `script-src`, no `object-src` and no `base-uri`, so
// the document was served under no script policy at all.
//
// Adding `script-src` is not a one-line fix, which is why the policy moved here. A static
// `headers()` table cannot express a per-request value, and a script nonce is exactly that. Next
// serves its hydration bootstrap as an INLINE `<script>` carrying the Flight payload, so a bare
// `script-src 'self'` blocks it: the server HTML renders, `__next_f` never fills, React never
// attaches, and the console shows its controls while none of them does anything. The headers, the
// type-check, the build and every unit test stay green throughout.
//
// So the nonce is minted per request in `proxy.ts`, this module builds the policy from it, and
// `next.config.mjs` no longer emits a `Content-Security-Policy` at all. Two layers both setting it
// would give the browser two policies to intersect, per directive, stricter wins, which quietly
// reinstates the defect this module exists to remove.
//
// `ui/scripts/assert-hydratable.mjs` is the check that can actually see the failure: it starts the
// built server and asserts every script tag in the served document carries the served nonce. The
// unit tests here cover what a STRING can decide, which is less than it looks like.
