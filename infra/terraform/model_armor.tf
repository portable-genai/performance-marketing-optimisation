# model_armor.tf : the Model Armor guardrail template the gcp guardrail adapter screens through.
#
# THIS FILE DID NOT EXIST. `config/settings.yaml` names `model_armor.template_id:
# mkt-perf-guardrail`, `adapters/gcp/model_armor_guardrail.py` posts every screen to
# `.../locations/<region>/templates/mkt-perf-guardrail:sanitize*`, `iam.tf` grants
# `roles/modelarmor.user` and `apis.tf` enables the API, and nothing created the template. Every
# guardrail screen on a deployment would have been refused by a template that was never
# provisioned. Reuses the shape `marketing-compliance-gate/infra/terraform/model_armor.tf`
# already fixed for the same defect.
#
# Control map (SPEC concern):
#   Guardrail screening: prompt injection, jailbreak and the responsible-AI categories on both
#     directions of every report / narration call the guardrail port screens.
#   Residency: the template is created in var.region and called on the regional host
#     (config/settings.yaml model_armor.host).
# verify: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/model_armor_template
