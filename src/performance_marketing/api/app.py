"""FastAPI app — thin HTTP boundary over the domain services.

Owns no business logic: it translates a request into a domain call and serialises the cited
result with ``to_jsonable``. Heavy / cloud imports stay lazy so importing this module under
the local profile needs no Google Cloud SDK.

Identity is server-verified: every route depends on :data:`CurrentPrincipal`, and the audit
actor is taken from the verified :class:`Principal` (never a client-supplied field). The
embedding surface is controlled here too: an env-driven per-tenant CORS allowlist (never
``"*"``) and a CSP ``frame-ancestors`` middleware that governs who may iframe the UI.
