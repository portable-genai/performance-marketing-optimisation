"""The D4 Performance Marketing ADK agent package.

Exposes the ADK-convention ``root_agent`` (discovered by ``adk web`` / Agent Runtime) plus the
explicit factories used by the API and tests. Everything here is import-safe without ADK
installed: the ADK-heavy construction is quarantined behind lazy imports (SPEC §4), so importing
this package under the local / on-prem / test profile never requires ``google.adk``.
