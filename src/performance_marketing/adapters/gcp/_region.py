"""Residency-region validation for the GCP adapter family (D4).

D4 supports the three APAC markets (JP, AU, SG) and each carries a residency region
(``asia-northeast1`` Tokyo, ``australia-southeast1``, ``asia-southeast1`` Singapore). The
region is **selectable at deploy and validated**: a GCP adapter resolves the effective
region from the active market (or the explicit ``settings.region``) and refuses to talk to a
region outside the allow-list, so data never leaves the configured residency boundary.

This module is pure stdlib (no Google import), so importing a GCP adapter under the local /
on-prem / test profile never pulls in ``google-*``. The allow-list is derived from
:data:`performance_marketing.domain.models.MARKET_PROFILES`, which is itself config + seed
(``config/settings.yaml`` may override a market's region), so regions are never hard-coded
into a branch here.
