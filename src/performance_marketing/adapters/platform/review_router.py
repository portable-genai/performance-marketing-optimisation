"""Platform ReviewRouterPort: submit the routed report review to human-review-console via
``review-kit``.

Builds the review from the escalated performance report and submits it to the human-review-console
service intake (``POST /v1/service/reviews``), S2S-authenticated. The human-review-console base URL
comes from the environment (``HUMAN_REVIEW_URL``) and the S2S credentials from this repo's shared
env-var names (``S2S_TOKEN`` / ``S2S_SIGNING_KEY``, the same pair the other platform delegates use).
No cloud SDK is involved (the kit uses stdlib ``urllib`` + wire-compatible S2S headers), so this
module imports cleanly with no GCP SDK; it is bound under the ``gcp`` and ``platform`` profiles
because it makes a real network call to a sibling service.
