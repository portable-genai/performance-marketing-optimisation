"""Local ReviewRouterPort: enqueue the routed review to an in-memory outbox (no live
human-review-console).

Exercises the R8 routing path offline: an escalated performance report is converted to a review and
enqueued (the same transactional outbox the platform adapter flushes to human-review-console), so
tests and the offline demo can assert that an escalation is routed without a running console.
