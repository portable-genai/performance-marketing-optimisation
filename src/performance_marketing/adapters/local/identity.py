"""Local IdentityPort adapter: seeded dev personas, NO IdP / AD / LDAP.

The SDK-free ``local`` profile must run with zero authentication so demos and tests work
fully offline. This adapter resolves a :class:`Principal` from a small set of seeded
personas, selected by the ``X-Dev-Persona`` request header (the UI's persona picker),
defaulting to the first persona when none is supplied. It lets you exercise per-user
authorization (different entitlement principals and tenants, including a cross-tenant
persona) without standing up any identity provider. It is bound ONLY under the local
profile; secure mode uses the IAP adapter, which verifies a real assertion.

These personas are an UNAUTHENTICATED grant of a tenant identity, and this system's
authorization is per-tenant, so the adapter refuses to construct unless the local profile was
chosen deliberately: the profile must actually be ``local`` AND ``MKT_PERF_PROFILE`` (or the
reviewed settings file) must have named it rather than it being inherited from a fallback. A
missing env var therefore fails closed instead of handing out a demo identity.
