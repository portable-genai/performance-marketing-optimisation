"""IdentityPort — resolve a verified Principal from inbound transport context.

The hexagon boundary for authentication. The API layer hands the adapter a
:class:`~performance_marketing.domain.identity.RequestContext` (the request headers) and gets
back a verified :class:`~performance_marketing.domain.identity.Principal`, or an
:class:`~performance_marketing.domain.identity.IdentityError`. The active profile picks the
adapter:

* ``local`` resolves a seeded dev persona (no IdP/AD/LDAP) so demos and tests run offline,
* ``gcp`` verifies the Identity-Aware-Proxy-injected signed assertion (auth configured on
  the GCP service), and
* ``onprem`` is the placeholder for the client's own enterprise IdP (OIDC/SAML).

This keeps the per-user identity decision swappable by configuration, exactly like every
other port, and is the single seam where the client-asserted actor/ACL is replaced by a
server-verified one.

The Protocol is RE-EXPORTED from :mod:`hex_service_kit.identity` rather than redeclared, for
the same reason as the observability ports: one definition, so the adapters in every repo are
checked against the same shape instead of against local copies that have quietly diverged.

Each adapter also DECLARES what it does for end-user authentication, because the profile
string cannot answer that question on its own: ``local`` and a rebound ``onprem`` both name a
posture, not a verification. :func:`declared_end_user_auth` reads the declaration, and
``config.end_user_auth_kind`` resolves it for the ACTIVE binding. The exposure guard in
``api/app.py`` is the consumer.
