"""The "never ``*``" rule the origin policy documents, actually enforced at boot.

Red before the fix: both allowlists were resolved with real care about the states an operator
can leave them in (unset keeps the shipped default, an emptied frame-ancestors becomes
``'none'`` rather than an absent header, an emptied CORS allowlist denies everything) and then
handed on VERBATIM. The prohibition on ``*`` existed only in a comment beside the resolver and
in the runbook table, so ``MKT_PERF_FRAME_ANCESTORS="*"`` shipped
``Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors *``, which permits ANY page anywhere to frame the
console, and ``MKT_PERF_CORS_ORIGINS="*"`` handed the same blanket trust to the CORS
middleware, which serves credentialed responses. A comment does not fail a build.

Green after: the resolvers refuse a wildcard in either allowlist. The refusal is a BOOT
refusal, raised where the values are resolved at import, so a deployment that names ``*``
never comes up and answers requests under a policy that trusts everybody. Any token carrying
``*`` is refused, not just a bare one: ``https://*.client.example`` is a real CSP host-source
wildcard and grants every subdomain, including one an attacker gets to register.

The three states this repo already resolves are UNCHANGED. This file pins them alongside the
new case, because a wildcard check bolted on carelessly is exactly the kind of change that
quietly turns "unset" back into "default" for the wrong branch.

    ``null`` was the hole. ``MKT_PERF_FRAME_ANCESTORS=null`` resolved to the string ``null``
    and shipped ``Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors null``, and
    ``MKT_PERF_CORS_ORIGINS=null`` put ``null`` in the credentialed CORS allowlist. A

    rights to any page that can open one, which is the framing this policy exists to refuse.
    It is a wildcard by behaviour while looking like an origin, so no asterisk test can see it.

    The asterisk-bearing spellings are pinned here too, against the rule that owns them: the
