"""The provenance the UI banner states must be true of the profile the service is running.

Every served console names, at the top of every page, WHERE it is running and WHICH model
answers (org decision, 2026-08-30). Both halves come from ``/healthz`` because the browser
cannot know either: a console that read its runtime from ``window.location`` would be right
until the day the deployment served through a proxy, and wrong silently after that.

The reason this is worth a test rather than a glance is what the banner is FOR. These systems
are demonstrated on a laptop and on a deployment, sometimes in the same hour, and a screenshot
of one is indistinguishable from the other. A banner that was merely present but wrong is worse
than no banner: it converts "the viewer does not know" into "the viewer has been told the wrong
thing", and the wrong thing here is whether a figure came from a managed model or from a
deterministic offline stub.

So the assertions below are about AGREEMENT with the profile, not about presence.
