"""The promotion gate's aggregate verdict must fail closed on an empty evaluation.

:attr:`EvalReport.passed` was ``all(r.passed for r in self.results)``. ``all(())`` is
vacuously True, so a report that scored nothing reported PASSED, and ``eval/run_eval.py``
exits ``0`` on ``passed``: an evaluation that measured nothing certified a promotion.

The first three tests were RED against that form before the fix landed, which is the only
reason they are worth keeping. The last two pin the behaviour that must NOT change: a real
evaluation still passes, and one failing metric still fails.
