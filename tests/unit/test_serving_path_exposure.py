"""The loopback bound is a property of the APP OBJECT, and this repo had no other place for it.

Every other repo in the fleet at least called ``resolve_bind_host`` in a ``main()``; this one
has no entry point at all. The Dockerfile CMD is
``exec uvicorn performance_marketing.api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT}`` and the Makefile
``run-api`` target serves the same object, so nothing bounded the unauthenticated posture
anywhere. Executed before the guard existed: a peer at 203.0.113.7 got ``200`` on
``GET /v1/personas`` with the complete seeded-persona list (subjects, tenants and entitlement
groups) off an unauthenticated ``local`` deployment.

Both directions are proved here, because a guard that refuses everybody would satisfy the
first claim while breaking the offline demo it exists to protect, and would be reverted:

* an off-loopback peer is refused with ``503`` before any route or dependency runs, and
* a loopback peer still gets the seeded personas and the working local demo.

The control is the last pair: a VERIFYING identity binding stands the guard down, so
"everything refuses a LAN peer" is not true for the boring reason that the guard is always on.
